# Myntra HackerRamp 

An idea to gamify the shopping experience on Myntra. 

We are introducing bidding system where users will be awarded coins with every purchase. These coins can be used to place bids on certain items in a certain window time. This will gamify the buying process as well as make customers visit again and again.  

## How to play ?

Step 1 : You buy some products and along with it you get some coins. \
Step 2 : Checkout the exclusive game section if there are some products that you like are available for bidding. \
Step 3 : Bid heavily, even if you donâ€™t win your coins will be safe for another game.
